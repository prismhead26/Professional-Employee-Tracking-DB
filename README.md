# Employee Tracker Database

## Description:
The main goal of this project is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. After completion of the project, I have a better understanding of building and modifying databases with the help of MySQL, a relational database management system, and also DBeaver to view to data visually. I also learned how to query data from multiple tables using raw MySQL. And lastly I learned some better ways to refactor and format the code, making it easier to read and modify. For this project, I challenged myself to create a class file for the queries and also separated inquirer to enforce separation of concerns.

## Usage Instructions:
Step 1: In order to run the application locally, MySQL must be installed.
<br>
Step 2: Connect to the server using MySQL in the same directory as the code.
<br>
Step 3: Source the Schema and Seeds files for the database.
<br>
Step 4: Open VsCode(preferred) or another source-code editor if not already running.
<br>
Step 5: Open integrated terminal once in the main folder.
<br>
Step 6: "run npm i" / "sudo npm i" in the terminal to install the required dependencies.
<br>
Step 7: Now to run the application, Enter "nodemon index.js" or "npm start" and "node index.js" if you don't have npm nodemon.
